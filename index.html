                    <h3>About this Website</h3>
                    <p>I built this website because I wanted a way to bulk download General Conference and BYU talks 
                        from apostles and prophets. I love listening to these talks on my walks and when doing other things, 
                        but it was annoying to have to click through every single one, download them individually, and then 
                        sort them all. My dad came up with the idea of using a program to automate it, and when I needed 
                        a project for work to practice my programming skills, this seemed like the perfect fit. Now, you 
                        can easily pick either BYU talks or General Conference talks or both and download them all in one go by 
                        clicking the Download button.</p>
